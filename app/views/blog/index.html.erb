		<p>When transferring data over the web to a mobile device every byte counts. There are many different formats these days to help in getting that data across the wire, and two most people are familiar with are <a href="#">XML</a> and <a href="#">JSON</a>. Now both of these data formats have their purposes, and have played a huge role in modern communication. However, today the modern world is mobile. People are more mobile than ever and technology has been keeping pace. The advent of smart phones has lead to what some might call an "always connected" society. While I may not agree that people should always be connected, there isn't much I can do to stop it. </p>
		<p>With this mind set people have become accustom using their mobile devices and interacting with apps that allow them to go about their day. People most often do not even realize just how much the app is doing for them, but they do realize very quickly when an app is <em>not</em> working for them. Apps that are slow, unintuitive, or require thought for action lead to one star reviews in app stores and a frustrated user base, who then runs and finds an alternative - <a href="#">leaving your app in the dust.</a></p>
		<p>What are some ways to improve apps such as these? Well, we can have many discussions about how to optimize apps in a variety of different ways, but today I want to talk about the best way to bring data over the wire.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#555">The Wrong Way</h3>
		<p>Mobile devices inherently have constrained resources. Although this improves with each new smart phones that hits the market, engineers must still be concerned with making their apps efficient. Now right off the bat, those apps that communicate with a web service fall squarely into the category where <strong>efficiency matters.</strong></p> Anyone who has worked in this realm should know that <a href="#">XML is a very bad idea</a> when the web service is sending data to mobile devices. It is extremely verbose which means that there is a lot of data being transferred. Over a cellular connection like 3G, (or dare I say, Edge?) this leads to apps that seems to the non-tech savvy user as "slow". And not only is XML bad for network performance, parsing of the data in itself is time consuming and takes quite a bit of CPU power.
		<h3 style="color:#555">Getting Closer</h3>
		<p>The other and probably most commonly used method is to send data over the wire in JSON format. It's lightweight on the network, fast to parse, and most web services can easily transform the data into JSON format. This was made much more preferable in my opinion when Apple added <a href="#">JSON parser</a> support into iOS 5. That along with some of the updates to the <a href="#">networking APIs</a> made digesting data from a web service on iOS pretty damn easy. And for the most part this is a perfectly acceptable way to create performant connected mobile apps.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#555">Binary Serialization - It's Bad Ass</h3>
		<p>Now if JSON performs well and your happy with the results of your app then by all means stop reading. But, there are many people out there who like taking things a step further (myself included). And for those of us who can't leave well enough alone, there is <a href="#">binary serialization</a>. This is basically taking the JSON one step further and sending data over the wire that a mobile device can inflate directly into memory and move onto the next task. No parsing is involved. And because no parsing is needed, no extra characters are needed in the data to act as delimiters etc. Sending binary data means sending the smallest payload possible and inflating objects into memory is very easy for a mobile device to do. It's a win-win for the mobile developer.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#555">By Example</h3>
		<p>Now that I have been talking about this for far too long, lets see how this works in action. From the iOS perspective, a common method one would write looks something like this:</p>
